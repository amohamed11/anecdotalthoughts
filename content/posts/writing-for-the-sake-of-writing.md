Writing is fun. Or at least, it can be sometimes. Yet often, I feel like I have forgotten that fact. I even recall thinking so, all the way back in 6th grade, despite my hatred for English class.

I remember one occasion where younger me, bored in class while the teacher read from some novel that should have instead been a play, opened my notes and scribbled down an incredibly original origin story for a super-hero called Lotus, which innovately involved explosion in a laboratory. My teacher, having noticed my head in my notebook, approached me, took my notes and read it before briefly commenting "glad you enjoy writing, but do it some other time". 

There is no real point to this story, matter-of-fact I had totally forgotten about it, until I wrote the first sentence of this article. It encapsulates had become my attitude towards creative writing, fiction or non. This idea, that there is always something more important, more meaningful, more productive to do than sitting down and simply writing for the sake of writing.

Now that I have graduated and gotten a full-time job, with it came a surprising existential crisis concerning what I do with my free time. "I play video games, what do you mean, what do you mean I need a new hobby?" is what the voice in my head responds to the hobby absurdist growing in me. Playing games has been, for the majority of my life, what I do with my free time. But for some reason I also thought of it as a central part of who I am as a person as well. Therefore, obviously, I needn't even consider anything else.
