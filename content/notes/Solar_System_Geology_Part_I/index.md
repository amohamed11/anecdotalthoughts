    - Period of revolution (length of year) is 88 days
    - 2:3 ratio; 2 Mercurian years to 3 Mercurian days; called spin-orbit coupling
- Planetary details vs Moon:
    - Diameter ⇒ 4,880km   vs  3,476km

    - Surface Temperature ⇒ **90 - 740K**  vs 100-400K **
- Heavily cratered terrain. with inter-crater plains and smooth plains.
- Large impact basins like **Caloris Basin**

### Cratering on Mercury

- Compared to the Moon
    - Ejecta is discontinuous and not as extensive, thanks to 2.5x gravity
    - Fewer craters smaller than 50km diameter than expected
    - Large basins are more degraded due to (gravity, volcanic, composition of surface)
    - Space weathering is more severe

### Inter-crater Plains

- **Inter-crater plains are the most extensive terrain on Mercury by area**. They look different than the heavily-cratered surfaces of the Moon.
- They level to gently rolling, densely cratered surfaces between craters.
- Densely cratered with many secondary craters ( < 10km), resulting in a highly textured surface
    - Many craters are degraded and partially filled with smooth material
- Most likely formed by combination of volcanism and impact cratering happened concurrently. And/or the surface remained hot/plastic at the time of impact.

### Smooth Plains

- Some areas are smooth, sparsely cratered plains that are similar to lunar maria
- Covers ~1/3 of the surface, and is the youngest major terrain.
    - More concentrated in the North, as well around Caloris Basin
- Features:
    - Flow fronts ⇒ likely volcanic
    - Fewer craters ⇒ younger
    - Some have similar composition to Inter-crater plains

### Volcanic Features

### Models for Mercury

- There models for why the core is so large
    1. ✔️Accreted from a mix that included more metal

    ### Atmosphere of Venus
    
    - The thick atmosphere for many features unique to Venus
    - Made of CO2 (96.4%), N2 (3.5%), H2O (0.01%), and droplets of H2SO4
    - Effects:
        - **High surface temperatures (the Greenhouse effect)**
            - Thick atmosphere trap more heat from reflected light
        - **Lack of water**
            - If Venus and Earth started with same amount of H2O, whu does Venus have so much less?
                1. Water vapour outgassed from interior
                    
                    ![Untitled_7.png](Untitled_7.png)
                    
                2. Too hot for liquid water to condense
                3. Water vapour was lost to space
        - **Wind erosion and deposition**
            - The dense atmosphere is able to move materials across the surface
            - Dense atmosphere can transfer kinetic energy to particles more easily than on Earth
        - **Weathering**
            - Evidence for weathering on Venus exists from radar reflective bright and dark zones which correlate with elevation
            - No water, but thick atmosphere
                
                ![Untitled_8.png](Untitled_8.png)
                
    
    ### Impact Craters on Venus

    - No heavily-cratered terrains like Mercury or the Moon
    - Abouut 1000 craters identified
        - Diameter ⇒ 1.5 - 280km (Meade Crater)
        - Evenly distributed, not very degraded
    - Suggests average age of **0.5Ga** (±0.3)
    - Major differences from the Moon and Mercury:
        - No craters less than 1.5km in diameter
        - Diffuse splotches attest to "near hits"
        - Ejecta deposits
            - Petal-shaped, not as extensive
            - Flow long distances
            - Arc-shaped due to blowing wind
        - Attributable to thick atmosphere

### Geologic History of Venus

- Average surface age of **0.75Ga**
    - Is this resurfacing due catastrophic events or gradual?
- **Catastrophic:**
    - Periodic resurfacing events on a global scale
    - Changes from **recycling (Earth like plate tectonic) to hot-spot volcanism (mantle plume with single plate)**
- **Gradual:**
    - Resurfacing of areas ~150,000km^2 at a time
    - Allows for even distribution of craters
- The transition from recycling to hot-spot volcanism occured within the past ~1Ga and is still in transition today. Triggered by loss of surface/crustal water

### Recent Volcanic Activity

- **Venus Express:**
    - Detected high emissivity regions using an infrared image around volcanoes.
        - High emissivity probably from unweathered basalt
        - Evidence of recent (250,000 year) lava flows?
    - Detected high sulfur dioxide in atmosphere in 2006, followed by a sharp decrease
        - Evidence of active eurption?

### Early Volcanism

- Patera (“saucer”):
    - A volcano of broad areal extent with little vertical relief
    - Example: Apollinaris Mons
        - Active from Late Noachian to Late Hesperian
        - Built up by both pyroclastic and effusive eruptions

### Dendritic Valley Networks

- Dendritic valleys in the ancient highlands, 4.0 –3.6 Ga, support the idea of an ancient hydrologic cycle
- Origin is debated:
    - Denser atmosphere →rainfall →streams
    - Groundwater seepage (spring)

### Outflow channels

- Long deep channels concentrated along the dichotomy boundary are the result of catastrophic outflow
- Associated chaotic terrain

### Mineralogic History of Mars
