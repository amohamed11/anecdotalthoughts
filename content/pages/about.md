# Anecdotal Thoughts

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anas. I recently finished wrapping up my CS degree at UAlberta, and currently work on cool stuff over at [Areto Labs](https://www.aretolabs.com/). I enjoy mucking about & learning new stuff. This is my tiny corner on the web, and here I like to jott down my thoughts, anecdotal might they be.

For what I'm up to recently, check out the [/now](/now) page.
