# Anas Mohamed

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anas. I recently finished wrapping up my CS degree at UAlberta, and currently work on cool stuff over at [Areto Labs](https://www.aretolabs.com/).  
I enjoy mucking about & learning new stuff. I like jotting down some of my thoughts, and things that I have learned here.
