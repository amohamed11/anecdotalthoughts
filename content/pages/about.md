Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anas. I work with software, write occasionally, and generally try to make stuff.  

I enjoy mucking about, this here is my tiny corner on the web, where I try colaesce my thoughts into readable form for some reason.

For what I'm up to recently, check out the (most likely out-of-date) [/now](/now) page.
