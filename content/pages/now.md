- The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran 

**Read in 2021**

1. *The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli* --> beautiful book that forever alters the concept of time to me. 4/5
2. *Foundation by Isaac Asimov* --> really cool concept with original ideas that have aged amazingly well. 4/5
3. *Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke* --> surprisingly coherent thematically considering it's a series of letters over 5 years. Regardless it obscure in its exploration of solitude. 3/5
