## Projects

- [chibiOS](https://github.com/amohamed11/chibiOS): learning more about OS development via Oppermann's fantastic blog [series](https://os.phil-opp.com/).
- [kitab](https://git.sr.ht/~anecdotal/kitab): a minimal note-taking web app built in Go with Gin & GORM. Mostly to mess around with back-end dev in Go. 
- Reworked the blog infrastructure for fun: now deployed on a VM with Caddy for serving, and prometheus+grafana for metrics.

## Recently Enjoyed

- Warhammer 40K lore -> been binging lots of 40K lore, mostly through [Luetin09's](https://www.youtube.com/c/Luetin09/videos) amazing videos.

**Played in 2022**

- *Elden Ring* -> obsessed over this game for 2 months straight for a total of 90 hours. Absolutely phenomenal game and my intro to the From Software games. **5/5**
- *Tiny Tina Wonderland* -> surpisingly short (but fun) campagin with lots of bugs, but still a good time with friends. 2.5/5
- *Forward: Escape the Fold* -> a fun card-based roguelike to play while having something on the background. 3/5

### Books

**Currently**

-  *Artifact Space* by Miles Cameron 

**Read in 2022**

1. *The Order of Time* by Carlo Rovelli --> beautiful book that forever alters the concept of time to me. 4/5
2. *Foundation* by Isaac Asimov --> really cool concept with original ideas that have aged amazingly well. 4/5
3. *Letters to a Young Poet* by Rainer Maria Rilke --> surprisingly coherent thematically considering it's a series of letters over 5 years. Regardless it obscure in its exploration of solitude. 2/5
4. *The Prophet* by Kahlil Gibran --> beautiful & poetic prose with many memorable one-liners & metaphors. Basically what self-help books whish they were. 3/5
5. *Why Fish Don't Exist* -> a beautiful interweaving narrative that mixes an autobiography, a historical biography, and more than dash of existentialism. 3/5
